    content: `We provide comprehensive CGI animation services including 3D modeling and character creation, photorealistic rendering, architectural visualization, product animations, visual effects (VFX), medical and scientific visualizations, and virtual reality content. Each project is customized to meet your specific visual communication goals.`,

    id: "accordion-panel-2",
    title: "How does your CGI animation process work?",
    content: `Our process begins with concept development and storyboarding to establish the creative direction. We then create 3D models, textures, and environments before setting up lighting and cameras. After client approval of initial renders, we proceed with animation, rendering, and post-production effects. Each step includes client feedback to ensure the final product exceeds expectations.`,

    title: "What industries benefit most from CGI animation?",
    content: `CGI animation provides significant value across numerous industries including architecture and real estate (for visualizing unbuilt properties), product manufacturing (for showcasing products before production), entertainment and media, healthcare (for medical visualizations), automotive, education, and advertising. Any field requiring clear visualization of complex concepts can benefit from CGI.`,

    title: "What's the difference between CGI and traditional animation?",
    content: `CGI (Computer Generated Imagery) animation uses 3D computer software to create digital models that can be manipulated in a virtual environment, allowing for photorealistic results and camera movements impossible in traditional animation. Traditional animation involves hand-drawing or manipulating physical objects frame-by-frame. CGI offers greater flexibility, realism, and efficiency for complex visual projects.`,

    id: "accordion-panel-5",
    title: "How can CGI animation benefit my business?",
    content: `CGI animation helps businesses visualize products that don't yet exist, create immersive experiences that increase engagement, demonstrate complex processes clearly, reduce production costs compared to physical photography or video, maintain complete creative control, and easily update content as needed. It's particularly valuable for creating memorable brand experiences that stand out in today's competitive market.`,
